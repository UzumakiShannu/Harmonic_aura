# 🧘 Harmonic Aura – Chakra-Based Meditation System with Sensor Feedback

**Live Demo:** [https://harmonic-aura.web.app](https://harmonic-aura.web.app)

Harmonic Aura is a meditation-focused web application developed using React and TypeScript. It interfaces with hardware sensors (EMG, heart rate, and temperature) to detect energetic imbalances and trigger chakra-specific healing tones (Hz frequencies). The system was built during a guided internship project to blend wellness principles with modern web and IoT technology.

## ✨ Key Features

- Chakra detection based on sensor input (EMG, HR, Temp)
- Plays corresponding Hz sound frequencies for energetic alignment
- Clean, mobile-responsive UI for chakra visualization and awareness
- Built using React + TypeScript and deployed via Firebase Hosting

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, HTML5, CSS3
- **Hardware (External):** Arduino, exg Synapse kit
- **Platform:** Firebase Hosting
